Source code to generate figures from the manuscript "Optimal experiment design for physiological parameter estimation using hyperpolarized carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy" by John Maidens, Peder E. Z. Larson and Murat Arcak. 

To generate figures, please ensure that the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed and included on your path: 
* Optimization Toolbox
* Symbolic Math Toolbox. 

The figures can be generated by running the file RUN_ME.m. 

This code has been tested using MATLAB version R2013b (8.2.0.701) for 64-bit mac with Symbolic Math Toolbox Version 5.11 and Optimization Toolbox Version 6.4.
